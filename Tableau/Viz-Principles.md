# Data Visualization Notes

## Data Visualization Principles

* **Clarify** : It should show very clear object. The visualization should be aligned with the Problem Statement.

* **Simplify** : It should be simple enough that the end audience is easily able to understand the message without taking too much time. Shouldn't be too much complex.

* **Compare** : Side by side Comparison of two charts wherever required.

* **Attend** : It should capture the attention of the viewer i.e. it should have the relevant data the viewer may be interested to see. (Eg. Don't show revenue data if viewer interested in Sales data). Color, title, axis etc. capture the attention.

* **Explore** : Visualization should discover new things i.e. viewer should be able to derive new insights from the graphs. Eg. Detecting outliers.

* **View Data Diversely** : Should provide multiple angle approach i.e. whole 360 degree view should be available to the viewer. We should not create our whole visualization with only bar charts or histograms (so many other types of charts available, use as per requirement).

* **Ask Why** : If viewer asks questions based on the Visualization, it should be welcomed (because it invoked curiosity of the viewer). But the number of questions should be less (otherwise it may mean that we have missed conveying important information in the visualization).

* **Be Skeptical** : Sometimes Visualization may look pretty but may not be conveying the message properly, or even may be misguiding also to the viewer. Avoid that.

* **Respond** : The visualization should be responsive and provide interactivity, so that it become self-explanatory.  We may also have to display data along with chart (for eg. On mouse hover), if required.

* **Detail** : Visualization should have several levels of details and it should be shown level by level (instead of showing all the details in a single chart).

* **Validate** : We should be able to explain any chart if asked for. What formula has been applied and what data has been used, its source, urls etc.

## Visualization Mistakes (to avoid)

1. Numbers don't add up (eg. In a pie chart addition is going over 100%).
2. Not following convention (eg. Inverting the axis, making the chart upside down)
3. Cropped axis (One bar chart can be made to look a lot bigger than other by cropping axis).
4. Not using Annotations ( eg. if a graph decreases/increases rapidly at a point, then we should provide more information at that point to explain it)
5. Improper bubble size ( eg. Values and bubble size don't match giving wrong impression)
6. Incomplete Data (eg. One state may have more Covid cases even if it is small, so we shouldn't just go with the coloring of the state on the graph).
7. Hard to Compare (eg. if we use pie charts and not provide percentage, it would be very hard to compare).
